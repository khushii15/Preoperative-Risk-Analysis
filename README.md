The "ML-Based Assessment of Postoperative Mortality Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery Patients" project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model
that accurately assesses individual patient risk of postoperative mortality based on preoperative data from the VitalDB database while excluding 
underage and emergency cases. The project's goal is to provide physicians with a comprehensible tool to analyze personal risk factors, enabling 
early recognition of complications and the tailored planning of intraoperative management and postoperative care.
